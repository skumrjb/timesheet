# timesheet
A simple program that records your time in and out like a timesheet and exports the results to a timesheet log spreadsheet

Goal of the timesheet is to ensure I have reached 4 hours of focussed productive work workflow everyday:

 Aim - Open the terminal and Run the script to note the start of the clock

 2 - User types in the timesheet code - 'in' to start the clock details of the day 

 3 - User types in the timesheet code - 'out' end the program records the timeout and time are stored in the .csv

     this action will also record the total time of the session in a separate column

 4 - if the clock is started later in the day - the timesheet should be able to do steps 2 and 3

 5 - at the end of the week (Sunday) a graph is plotted against day of the week and number of hours spent - incomplete

 6 - the results are saved in the directory as a jpg and sent as an attachment to my email id - incomplete
